    <p>Whether you’re just starting to price out your dream restaurant or checking on the overall health of your business, there are several metrics you should continually keep track of.</p>
    <p>These metrics represent different ways of looking at the health of a business allowing you to set goals, identify trends both positive and negative, and accurately gauge results of the operational tweaks you may make to your restaurant.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>Metric #1: Break-Even Point</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>Simply put, your “break-even point” is the point at which your business revenue is equal to your restaurant’s expenses and operating costs.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why it’s important:</h3>
            <p>Why it’s important:This calculation takes into account all the costs you’ll incur while running your business, then outlines your sales threshold. A sales threshold is the amount of monthly sales you’ll have to make in order to turn a profit.</p>

            <h3>How to calculate:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Say your restaurant sells <strong>$20,000 worth</strong> of products for the month of July</li>
                <li>If you paid <strong>$5,000</strong> in variable costs, and <strong>$7,000</strong> in fixed costs, your break-even point for the month would be <strong>$9,333.33</strong>.</li>
                <li>This means that your restaurant begins turning a profit after selling <strong>$9,333.33</strong> worth of goods or services.</li>

            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In this example, <strong>$20,000 - $5,000</strong> (Sales minus Variable Cost) equals <strong>$15,000</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>$15,000</strong> divided by <strong>$20,000</strong> equals <strong>0.75</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>$7,000 (fixed costs)</strong> divided by <strong>0.75</strong> gives you a  break-even point of <strong>$9,333.33</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>When to calculate:</h3>
            <p>Calculate your break-even point before you open your business, then adjust accordingly as you accrue various business expenses. Use this figure to quickly justify a big new purchase or launch a marketing campaign.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Good to know:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Variable Costs = </strong>Costs that may change due to business or environmental factors. These could include food and labor costs based on how busy your restaurant is, heating and cooling in winter and summer months, or advertising and marketing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Fixed Costs = </strong>Costs which typically do not change, such as rent, utilities, and salary, also known as ‘overhead’ as outlined below.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Metric #2: Overhead Rate</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>Fixed costs (or overhead) are just that — repeating, expected business expenses that typically do not change in cost, which are invoiced then paid on a periodic basis. These could include rent, insurance, property taxes, equipment rentals, utilities, and monthly or non-rate driven employee salaries. When calculated as a rate, this tells you how much you are spending each day, week, month, or year just to keep the doors open.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why it’s important:</h3>
            <p>Calculating an overhead rate helps you understand just how much it costs just to keep your doors open on a day-to-day, or even hourly basis.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>How to calculate:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Go through all the monthly bills</strong> your prospective restaurant may receive and total the cost for these expenses. This gives you a total fixed cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine a fiscal period</strong> — many restaurants use 13, 28-day periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate how many total hours your business will be open</strong> for the specified month.</li>
                <li>*<strong>Be sure to pay attention to the number of days in each month</strong> to accurately calculate your overhead rate. “Thirty days hath September, April, June, and November; all the rest have thirty-one, except for February alone.”</li>
                <li><strong>Divide the total fixed cost by the total number of hours</strong> your business will be open for the month to determine an overhead rate.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Say your total fixed costs for the month are <strong>$7,000</strong> and your restaurant is open <strong>8 hours a day, 7 days a week</strong>.</li>
                <li>For a 31-day month, 8 (hours) x 31 (days) means your business is open for a total of 248 hours.</li>
                <li>For a <strong>28-day month, 8 (hours) x 28 (days)</strong> means <strong>your business is open for a total of 224 hours</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Take the total fixed costs and divide by the total number of hours your restaurant will be open for the month.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>$7,000 (fixed costs)</strong> divided by<strong> 248 (hours)</strong> gives an overhead of <strong>$1,580.88 per week, $225.84 per day</strong>, and <strong>$28.23 per hour</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>$7,000 (fixed costs)</strong> divided by <strong>224 (hours)</strong> gives an overhead of <strong>$1750.00 per week, $250.00 per day</strong>, and <strong>$31.25 per hour</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>When to calculate:</h3>
            <p>One’s overhead can be calculated using actual figures (from past bills and receipts) or projected figures (by making an educated guess). Using projected figures is a great way to determine a forecasted overhead rate, which can be useful when mapping out operational processes before opening your business. Using actual figures shows how the operational tweaks you make impact your day-to-day business.</p>

        <h2>Metric #3: Food Costs</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>Your food cost is the amount you spend on food per month, taking into account inventory at the beginning of the month, purchases made within the month, and any goods left over at the end of the month.</p>
            <p>Food costs are one aspect of the total cost of goods sold (CoGS), but may not include all of the costs that go into the equation.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why it’s important:</h3>
            <p>Use this calculation to continuously monitor your supply of ingredients and inventory.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>How to calculate:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Determine a period to measure</strong> — a good way to go about this is once each month, or each time you purchase goods.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine the value of the inventory</strong> you have left over from the <strong>previous period</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate the sum of your total purchases for the period.</strong> This is typically the food you’ve purchased for the month.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine the value of the inventory</strong> you have left over at the <strong>end of the period</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Subtract the total you have left over</strong> at the end of the period, from the <strong>total you had left over at the beginning of the period</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Add this new number</strong> (the difference) to your total purchases to determine your CoGS.</li>

        <h2>Metric #4: Food Cost Percentage (Theoretical)</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>The percentage of a dish’s selling price that it costs to create it. Said differently, the percentage of your dishes’ prices that are taken up by the cost of the food used in that dish.</p>
            <p>Eventually you’ll want to compare your business’ food costs with industry standards, so the way in which you calculate these figures should be consistent with industry practices.</p>
            <p>Industry averages are based on the Uniform System of Accounts for Restaurants: A Guide to Standardized Restaurant Accounting, Financial Controls, Record-Keeping and Relevant Tax Matters, a standard textbook for North American restaurant accounting since the late 50’s <sup><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Uniform-System-Accounts-Restaurants-Standardized/dp/1931400733" target="_blank">[29]</a></sup>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Why it’s important:</h3>
            <p>Determining a food cost percentage allows you to know how much you’re spending on the food used in your meals and use that to determine or update pricing. Generally speaking, food cost percentages should account for 25%-35% of an individual dish. For example, if it costs $1 to create a taco, it’s wise to sell this item for around $2.90 (35%) to $4.00 (25%). Food costs and labor costs combined should account for 50%-65% of total sales.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>How to calculate:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Determine a period</strong> — one way to go about this is to collect all the elements which will be included in your food cost calculations (gross sales, inventories, and purchases) and create your period based on this time frame. For example, if you purchase goods and do inventory twice per month, check your food cost percentage on a biweekly basis.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine your total gross sales</strong> — for this period let’s say you sold $20,000 worth of food and beverages.</li>
                <li><strong>Determine your food cost (CoGS)</strong> using the calculation above.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Calculate your food cost % using the calculation below.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple by 100 to get a percentage.</strong></li>

        <h2>Metric #5: Labour Cost Percentage</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>What it is:</h3>
            <p>Similar to food cost percentage, labour cost and its percentage is the amount you spend on labour relative to the total sales for a given period. Minimum wage and tip amounts, beverage sales, quality of food and service, pricing, and hours of operation all greatly impact your food and labour costs.</p>
            <p>Why it’s important: Much like food costs, labour costs, when analyzed month-over-month, can quickly help you identify operational issues within your business.</p>

        <h2>How to Measure and Use These Metrics</h2>
        <p>Numbers are great, but how you use them is what ultimately matters.</p>
        <p>When you measure these metrics, they give you impactful of insights into your restaurant business and how it’s running. But you need to know how to use that data in order to learn and improve.</p>
        <p>Here are some general rules to follow:</p>
        <section>
            <h3>Always Use Apples to Apples Comparisons</h3>
            <p>In most cases, it’s wise to establish a period that you’d like to analyze, and keep it consistent across all metrics. This could be a weekly period, 28-day cycle, or quarterly basis usually determined by the fiscal demands of your business. This allows you to set a baseline for your calculations, sync goals and achievements, and ensures you’re always comparing apples to apples when discussing different metrics.</p>

            <h3>Take a Full View of Restaurant Operations</h3>
            <p>Don’t use singular metrics, instead, analyze several aspects of your business at once. One metric alone won’t give you an overall picture of your business’ health but using several in conjunction will give further insight.</p>

            <h3>Measure from the Bottom Up</h3>
            <p>When it comes to calculating metrics, begin with the more specific calculations first. Once that’s completed it’s easy to use these figures to do your high-level equations next. Most restaurant accounting software will help you make these calculations in real-time.</p>
            <p>For example, when calculating break-even point, one would start by subtracting variable costs from sales, then dividing this by your total sales to get a percentage. Carry this percentage further into the equation to easily determine your break-even point!</p>

            <p>Your metrics will only be as accurate as you are disciplined and diligent when creating them. The more effort you put into these calculations from the get-go, the easier they will be to update and maintain in the future. Carefully gather data and try to account for the wide array of variable costs and factors that may affect the overall health of your business.
