            The Chain Games lotto has been developed to be provably fair through
            an entropic and fully decentralised selection protocol that can be
            processed by any staking node on the network and validated by every
            other node on the network as it is accepted by the network.
          </p>

          <p>
            The winner is derived directly from the proof-of-stake hash of the
            block that pays out the lotto. This way, the lotto results are tied
            directly to the mechanism that is used to secure the blockchain. The
            modulo of the number of entries over the proof-of-stake hash is used
            to determine the winning entry number to select the winner to
            receive 80% of the pot, 18% is burned and 2% goes to the OMNâ€™s.
